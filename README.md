# Economic-analysis
## Economic analysis using pandas and Fred API

This project uses pandas to analyze economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, with a focus on extracting data related to the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate.

The project utilizes the FRED API to retrieve data, which is then cleaned and organized using pandas. The data is then visualized using matplotlib to provide an overview of how the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate have varied over time.

The analysis provides insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the labor market. The visualizations show that the unemployment rate spiked during the initial stages of the pandemic, but has since declined as the economy has reopened. Additionally, the labor force participation rate has also been affected by the pandemic, with a decline in participation during the pandemic period.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of pandas and data visualization libraries like matplotlib for analyzing economic data and gaining insights into important trends and patterns.
